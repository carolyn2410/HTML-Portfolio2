<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, I grew up all over the south before landing in Nashville, Tennessee in 2014.
  I have a Bachelors degree in Biology, but I have never applied my degree. 
  I have had various jobs throughout my life and now I would like to explore
  different careers.

<p>I have a cat named, Cujo, and he is my lifeline, haha.
